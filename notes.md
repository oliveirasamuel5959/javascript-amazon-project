## Rules for JavaScript Software Development

1. Save the data (Model)
2. Generate the HTML (View)
3. Make it interactive (Controller)

## Jasmine Testing Framework

1. Make changes to code
2. Re-run the tests
3. Save to Git

## Object-Oriented Programming (Organize code into objects)

1. Class is an object generator
2. Atributes and methods
3. Private and public properties and methods
4. Inheritance lets us reuse code between classes

## Backend

1. Manages the data of the software
2. Frontend sends information to backend using API through HTTP Protocol
3. Promises to handle async code instead of callbacks
4. Fetch HTTP requests
5. Using fetch with promises steps to GET from API Data
6. Async Await (Even better way to handle asynchronous code)
7. async function test() {} (async makes a function return a promise)
8. Use async await, over promises and callbacks
9. Error Handling
